## Description

Bounce is an iOS app designed to add spontaneity to your day. Users input typical morning, afternoon, and evening activities, along with their sleep preferences. Bounce then curates a unique yet randomized daily schedule from these entries.

## Why?

### It's fun.
Bounce was born out of the monotony I felt during the early days of the COVID-19 quarantine. Day after day, routines became repetitive, and life felt stale. I've always relished spontaneity and the thrill of the unexpected. The idea of entrusting the course of your day to an algorithm, to bring in that element of surprise, just seemed irresistibly fun.

### More growth!
Beyond the sheer fun of it, I deeply believe that we evolve through experiences. However, I've observed that many often hesitate to step out of their comfort zones and embark on new adventures. Bounce aims to bridge that gap. The underlying philosophy is that most people do have the time for novel experiences; they just need a nudge in figuring out how to carve out that time. Bounce provides that playful push towards exploration and growth.

**Bounce lays out the adventure; all you have to do is live it.**
